# Notes on how to use this code:

## Getting data:

The only mode we can use remotely is Multi-Channel Analysis (MCA) mode. Before lowering the REM500 into the pit, put it in MCA mode before. This is the optional multichannel analyzer mode and is used to dump the contents of the memory to an external computer for analysis (see manual for details).
